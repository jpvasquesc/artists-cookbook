        <p>Contribution by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a>. Invented by the Cossacks, in Siberia.</p>
        <p>Can be prepared on horseback, at swift gallop, if conditions make this a necessity.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop one half pound (per person) of the very best beef obtainable.</li>
            <li>Shape it carefully with artistry into a bird’s nest.</li>
            <li>Place on porcelain plate of a solid color — ivory is the best setting — so that no pattern will disturb the distribution of ingredients.</li>
            <li>In hollow center of nest, permit two egg yolks to recline.</li>
            <li>Like a wreath surrounding the nest of chopped meat, arrange on border of plate in small, separate bouquets:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Chopped raw white onion</li>
                <li>Bright green capers</li>
                <li>Curled silvers of anchovy</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley, chopped fine</li>
                <li>Black olives minutely chopped in company with yellow celery leaves</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Consumption</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Each guest , with his plate before him, lifts his fork and blends the ingredients with the egg yolks and meat.</li>
            <li>In center of table: Russian pumpernickel bread, sweet butter, and bottles of vin rosé.</li>
        </ul>
